        <br>
    <p>
      <b>1993</b> - Plotkin published <i>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</i>, which accounts his travels in the Amazon, his time spent with shamans, and his investigation into the medicinal properties of the plants they use.
        <br>
        <br>      
      <b>1995</b> - Along with Liliana Madrigal, Plotkin formed the Amazon Conservation Team (or ACT) which aims to protect the Amazonian rainforest with the help of the local indigenous tribes that live there.
        <br>
        <br>
      <b>1997</b> - Plotkin is featured in the IMAX film <i>Amazon</i>, written by photojournalist Loren McIntyre.
        <br>
        <br>
      <b>2000</b> - Plotkin's 2nd book titled <i>Medicine Quest</i> is published. This book documents the ethnobotanist's continued search for previously undiscovered natural medicines around the world.
        <br>

      <b>2001-2005</b> - In 2001, Time magazine called Mark Plotkin an "Environmental hero for the planet." In 2004, he receieved the Roy Chapman Andrews Distinguished Explorer Award. And in 2005 he was hailed by the Smithsonian as one of "35 Who Made a Difference."
       <br>
       <br>
      <b>2010</b> - Plotkin received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Lewis and Clark College, which read in part: "For teaching us that the loss of knowledge and species anywhere impoverishes us all; for combining humanitarian vision with academic rigor and moral sensibility; and for reminding us always, with clarity and passion and humor, that when we study people and plants, we are simultaneously exploring paths to philosophy, music, art, dance, reverence, and healing"
